# create an array of words and set as variable

#create correct guesses and incorrect guesses as variables

# generate a word at random 

# correct_guesses is less than the length of the word

# display the length of the word to the user

# prompt the user to guess a letter

#after user guess, check to see if it is correct

# if the guess is correct increment correct_guesses by 1

#if correct, load that letter into the word display

#if incorrect, load that letter into othe wrong letter display

# if the guess is incorrect increment incorrect_guesses by 1 
and draw the next part of the hangman

# if the incorrect_guesses is greater than 5, tell the user 
they lost and exit the program

# if correct_guesses is equal to the length of the word, tell the user they won
